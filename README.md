# final-project-starter

This is where you will create your Github repo for your final project. Instructions are on Canvas!

**Why are you interested in this field/domain?**
- Because COVID 19 is still prevalent in our lives and we want to know how COVID changed people's transport behavior.
  We also want to find out what the most popular transportation, especially in US and Washington State, compared to pre-COVID
  era and perhaps the reasoning behind their choice of transportation.

**What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?**
- Apple tracking the mobility trends during COVID era
- Impacts of COVID-19 on Transport modes through Twitter
- Multimodal transportation System Performance

**What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?**
- What mode of transportation is the most popular among Americans and how they shifted compared to pre-COVID days
- Relationship between mobility of people compared to the number of COVID-19 cases on the day
- The change between people using private transportation versus public transportation

**How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**

Apple Mobility Trends
- The data sent from users' devices to the Maps service is associated with random, ever-changing, identifiers. Thus, Apple does not have a profile of individual routes and searches. Apple Maps does not contain demographic information about our users. Therefore, we cannot make any statements about whether usage is representative of the population as a whole." This datasets lets users find out about mobility trends transformed by Covid-19. Reports reflect requests for directions in Apple Maps.

Google Mobility Trends
- Google collected the data through their applications for those users that has _Location History_ turned on
- The data is shows how your community is moving around differently due to COVID-19

Washington
- The Data is collected by WSDOT Toll Division, WSDOT Transportation Safety and Systems Analysis Division, and WSDOT TRACFLOW to provide public toll statics with specific location, date and amount in Washington state.

Covid19 Data
- The Times verifies, integrates and maintains the data set. They got original data from local health institutions or local governments.Â 

**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**

Apple Mobility Trends
- 4691 rows

Google Mobility Trends
- 7427209 rows

Washington
- 4271 rows

Covid19 Data
- National 650 rows
- States 33494 rows
- Counties 1871849 rows

**How many features (columns) are in the data?**

Apple Mobility Trends
- 659 columns

Google Mobility Trends
- 15 columns

Washington
- 6 columns

Covid19 Data
- National 3 columns
- States 5 columns
- Counties 6 columns

**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**

Apple Mobility Trends
- This dataset could answer the question that how does people change their transportation way after COVID-19 exposed. Or it could answer question that what are main ways or most popular ways that people will select to be their transportation option.

Google Mobility Trends
- By using this data set, we can learn about people's behavior during COVID-19 and where they went most often. We can also compare the shifts in some places during COVID spikes etc.

Washington
- By using this data set, we can have a brief idea on how traffics were impacted during COVID-19 breakout and how did traffic shifts on different date responding to dates. Moreover, by connecting this data set with other date set that track covid cases, we can understand how did traffic response to number of cases in Washington.

Covid19 Data
- It can be used to analysis the relationship between the number of cases and the mobility levels of people.
